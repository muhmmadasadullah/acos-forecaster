# ACoS Forecaster

This simple React application lets you forecast and visualize how changes to your cost per click (CPC) and conversion rate (CVR) affect your advertising cost of sale (ACoS). Enter your current advertising metrics on the left and experiment with different CPC and CVR values to see their impact on ACoS, estimated spend, orders and sales. A sensitivity chart highlights how a range of CVR values would change your ACoS at a fixed CPC.
